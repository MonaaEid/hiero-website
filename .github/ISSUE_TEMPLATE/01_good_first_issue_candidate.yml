        > ### 📋 Good First Issue (GFI) Guidelines
        > A Good First Issue generally has a narrow scope and clear instructions, with examples or solution provided.
        >        
        > Examples of acceptable GFI work include:
        >
        > - **Mechanical website changes that do not require deep architectural knowledge:**
        >   - Updating deprecated HTML tags or attributes
        >   - Replacing old CSS classes with new ones
        >   - Updating version numbers in configuration files
        >
        > - **Simple bug fixes with clear reproduction steps and expected behavior:**
        >   - Fixing a broken link or image
        >   - Correcting layout issues with clear CSS adjustments
        >   - Accessibility fixes (e.g., adding alt text) when explicitly instructed
        >
        > - **Documentation improvements** that are instruction-driven:
        >   - Fixing known typos or grammar issues
        >   - Updating README sections when new wording is provided
        >   - Making explicitly requested changes to comments or inline docs
        >
        > **What we do NOT consider Good First Issues:**
        >
        > - Writing new documentation or content without clear guidance
        > - Any change that requires deciding *what* to do or *how* something should behave
        > - Involves CSS, styling, or UX decisions without explicit instructions
        > - Bug fixes that require investigation to understand root cause
        > - Work spanning multiple subsystems or frameworks
        > - Tasks requiring domain, protocol, or architectural knowledge
        >
