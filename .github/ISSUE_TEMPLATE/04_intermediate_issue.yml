        ## **Thanks for contributing to the Hiero Website!** 🌐✨

        We truly appreciate your time and effort.  
        This template is designed to help you create an **Intermediate issue** for the Hiero Website project.

        The goal is to create an issue for contributors who have:
        - basic familiarity with the Hiero Website codebase (HUGO, Tailwind, Markdown content, etc.)
        - experience following our contribution workflow
        - confidence navigating existing components, pages, and documentation

      description: Who is this issue for?
      value: |
        This issue is intended for contributors who are already very familiar with the
        [Hiero Website](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-website) codebase and its architectural patterns.
  
        You should feel comfortable:
        - navigating `layouts/`, `content/`, `partials/`, and `static/` 
        - understanding Hugo templating concepts without step-by-step guidance 
        - following the standard PR workflow without additional onboarding

        If this is your very first contribution to the project, we recommend starting with a few
        **Good First Issues** before working on this one.

        > ### 🧭 What we consider an *Intermediate Website Issue* 
        > 
        > This issue generally: 
        > 
        > - Requires **some knowledge of the Hugo codebase**, but not deep architectural knowledge 
        > - Is **narrowly scoped** and well-contained 
        > - Is **low to medium risk**, not touching highly sensitive or critical infrastructure 
        > - May involve **refactors, content restructuring, or small feature additions** 
        > - Provides **enough documentation or examples** to reason about a solution 
        > - Often has **similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase** 
        > 
        > **What this issue is NOT:** 
        > - A beginner-friendly onboarding task 
        > - A large architectural redesign of the site 
        > - A change requiring extensive cross-module refactors 
        > - A breaking change to site infrastructure or deployment

        - is comfortable reading existing implementations

        Still, explain:
        - what is wrong or missing
        - where it lives in the codebase
        - why it matters
