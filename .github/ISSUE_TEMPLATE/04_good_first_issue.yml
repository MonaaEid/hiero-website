        We truly appreciate your time and effort. If this is your first open-source contribution, welcome!
        This template is designed to help you create a Good First Issue (GFI): a small, well-scoped task that helps new contributors learn the codebase and workflow.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > ### 📋 Good First Issue (GFI) Guidelines
        > A Good First Issue generally has a narrow scope and clear instructions, with examples or solution provided.
        >        
        > Examples of acceptable GFI work include:
        >
        > - **Very small, explicitly defined changes to website code or content**  
        >   *(rare and mechanical only — not behavior-changing)*, such as:
        >   - Fixing a broken link or image
        >   - Updating deprecated HTML tags or CSS classes
        >   - Correcting typos in text content
        > - **Refactors of existing examples or snippets** that are purely structural:
        >   - Splitting a long demo script into smaller functions
        >   - Combining multiple small snippets into one example  
        >   *(when explicitly instructed)*
        > - **Documentation improvements** that are instruction-driven:
        >   - Fixing known typos or grammar issues
        >   - Updating README sections when new wording is provided
        >   - Making explicitly requested changes to inline docs or comments
        > - **Functional improvements to examples**  
        >   *(only when the additional steps are explicitly described)*
        > - **Small, clearly specified edits to existing tests or lint rules**
        >
        > **What we do NOT consider Good First Issues:**
        >
        > - Writing new documentation, examples, or tests without clear guidance
        > - Any change that requires deciding *what* to do or *how* something should behave
        > - Changes to website architecture, frameworks, or public APIs
        > - Work spanning multiple subsystems or requiring deep design knowledge
        >
